# NLP Annotation Tools

Two lightweight, self-contained browser-based tools for annotating NLP and speech datasets. No installation, no server, no dependencies — just open the HTML file in any modern browser.

---

## Tools

### `aste.html` — Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE)

Annotate text sentences with structured sentiment triplets of the form **(target span, opinion span, sentiment)**.

![ASTE layout: sidebar sentence list · token canvas with arc arcs · right inspector panel]

#### Data Format

Each line in the input `.txt` file follows this structure:

```
token1 token2 ...#### #### ####[([target_indices], [opinion_indices], 'SENTIMENT')]
```

- Tokens are separated by spaces.
- The separator `#### #### ####` divides the sentence from its annotations.
- Token indices are **0-based** positions in the token list.
- Multiple triplets per sentence are comma-separated inside `[...]`.
- Sentiments: `POS`, `NEG`, `NEU`.

**Example:**
```
The battery life is great but the screen is terrible#### #### ####[([2, 3], [4], 'POS'), ([7], [9], 'NEG')]
```

Exported files include an extra tab-separated status column (`edited` / `confirmed`) so you can resume exactly where you left off.

#### How to Use

1. Click **📂 Import .txt** to load your annotation file.
2. Select a sentence from the left sidebar.
3. **Highlight** a range of tokens → a popup asks whether to label them as **Target** or **Opinion**.
4. **Drag** from a Target span to an Opinion span → choose the sentiment (POS / NEG / NEU) to create a relation arc.
5. **Click** any span or arc to inspect, change its role/sentiment, or delete it in the right panel.
6. Click **✔ Confirm & next** (or press `Enter`) to mark a sentence done and advance.
7. Click **💾 Export .txt** regularly to save your work.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `←` / `→` | Previous / next sentence |
| `Enter` | Confirm current sentence and advance |

#### Auto-save

Work in progress is automatically saved to `localStorage` and can be restored on next open. Exporting clears the draft.

### `ser.html` — Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

Label `.wav` audio files with one of three emotion classes: **negative**, **neutral**, or **positive**.

#### Data Format

The list file is a plain `.txt` with one entry per line. Labels are optional (useful for resuming):

```
audio_001.wav	negative
audio_002.wav
audio_003.wav	positive
```

Exported as `ser_output.txt` using the same format (tab-separated filename and label).

#### How to Use

1. Click **📁 Audio folder** and select the folder containing your `.wav` files.
2. Click **📄 List file (.txt)** and select your annotation list (can be a previously exported `ser_output.txt`).
3. If a browser draft exists for this folder, you will be asked whether to restore it.
4. The tool opens the first unlabeled file automatically.
5. Listen to the audio, then click **Negative / Neutral / Positive** (or press `1` / `2` / `3`).
6. Press **Enter** or click **💾 Save** to confirm and advance to the next file.
7. Click **💾 Export ser_output.txt** to download the labeled file.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `R` | Replay from the beginning |
| `1` | Label: Negative |
| `2` | Label: Neutral |
| `3` | Label: Positive |
| `Enter` | Save current label and advance |
| `J` / `K` | Next / previous file |

#### Audio Features

- Waveform visualization rendered on a Canvas element.
- Click anywhere on the waveform to seek to that position.
- Adjustable playback speed (0.5× – 2×).
- Volume slider supports **up to 300%** amplification via Web Audio API `GainNode`.

#### Auto-save

Labels are continuously saved to `localStorage` (keyed by folder name). Exporting clears the draft. Files missing from the selected folder are skipped but preserved in the export output.

#### Verify Mode

Tick the **✅ Verify task** checkbox in the toolbar to switch to adjudication mode. Here the list file holds the labels from two earlier annotators, and the current annotator picks one of the two.

Input list file is **3 columns** (tab-separated):

```
audio_001.wav	positive	neutral
audio_002.wav	negative	neutral
audio_003.wav	positive	positive
```

- Only the two reference labels are offered as choices for each file — you select one of them.
- Rows where both annotators **agree** (e.g. `audio_003.wav`) are auto-confirmed with that label; no action needed.
- Export adds a **4th column** with the chosen label: `filename	user1	user2	final`.
- On reload, a row is treated as done when its 4th column has a value.
- The tool detects a column-count mismatch between the checkbox state and the file, and offers to switch to the correct mode.

## Running

No setup required. Open either file directly in a browser:

```bash
open aste.html
open ser.html
```

Works fully offline. Tested in Chrome and Firefox.
